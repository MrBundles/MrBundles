This is my submission to the  Godot Wild Jam #28 (Theme: Egg)

Github Repository: https://github.com/MrBundles/WildJam28_Egg.git

Play as an egg trying to hatch and get back to the nest

A Note: In typical game jam style, this is not so much a fully fleshed-out game as an exploration of several new mechanics and programming challenges. Further levels may appear in the future but for the time being please enjoy the content that is there :)

Controls: Arrow Keys / WASD



If you would prefer to download the game you can access windows/mac/linux  files in my Github Repository noted above. (In the "Exports" folder)



Hope you enjoy it, Feedback is MUCH appreciated!

Please let me know if you find any game-breaking bugs so I can make note of them in the game description.
