A World-Bending Puzzle Platformer in a Minimalistic Art Style

PLEASE CHECK OUT THE GAME MODE DESCRIPTIONS BELOW



- Controls -

Move with Arrow Keys / WASD

Left Click - Turn your world upside down

Right Click - Remove nearby blocks

Reset - "R"

Pause - Click on the Player



- Use of Theme -

The game is primarily based on a "World-Swap" mechanic. When you click on a nearby block, all empty space in the level becomes solid ground and all solid ground becomes empty space.

The other main mechanic of the game is the ability to "dig" or remove nearby blocks. However, all that empty space created when you dig will become solid ground whenever you swap the world.

Thus, the LESS tiles in the current world the MORE tiles you will have in the swapped world.

Hopefully this makes more sense in the context of the game :D



*PRACTICE MODE*

The game is quite challenging in some of the later levels. Please make use of the practice mode if you are struggling on a particular level. Practice mode can be enabled from the settings menu or from the pause menu

The player is invincible when practice mode is enabled



*SPEEDRUN MODE*

Once you beat all of the levels you will unlock speedrun mode in which the controls are tweaked for faster gameplay and the best individual and summed times are shown in the level select screen



*HARDCORE MODE*

If you can achieve a sum-of-best-times less than 5 minutes you will unlock hardcore mode in which you can play a whole new set of MUCH more difficult levels



Hope you enjoy the game, Feedback is MUCH appreciated!

Please let me know if you find any game-breaking bugs or issues with the downloads so I can make note of it in the game description.
