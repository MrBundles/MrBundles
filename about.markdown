I work full time in industrial automation and enjoy making games in my free time.
I joined my first game jam in August of 2020 and have been somewhat obsessed ever since.
I try to release a game almost every month (both here and on [Itch.io])


Most of my games are based on mechanics that I find interesting or challenging, and thus I end up with a lot of puzzle games.

Please feel free to reach out with any questions or feedback and I will do my best to reply promptly.


If you are interested in checking out the source code for any of my games you can explore my work on [Github].
